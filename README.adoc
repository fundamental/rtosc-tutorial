Objective
---------

Create an OSC based sequencer/synth combo capiable of sounding vaugely like pink
floyd's "On The Run" arppeggio

Getting The Basics of Jack Running
----------------------------------

Before even writing any code for synthesis, the application must be able to talk
to jack.

[source,cpp]
------------------------------------------------------------------
include::01-basic-jack.c[]
------------------------------------------------------------------

Getting The Synthesis Setup
---------------------------

There are a number of ways to go about recreating this particilar sequence,
though for the momst part the standard way is to use the following components

- A square oscillator
- A noise  oscillator
- A low pass filter
- A sequencer for oscillator frequency and noise volume
- A low frequency oscillator for the filter's frequency

At this point the variables, constants, and parameters of the system should be
defined, though there won't be any rtosc involvment yet.

* Whole System
** Parameter: Sampling Frequency
* Oscillator
** Variable: Phase
* Noise Generator
** Stateless
* Sequencer
** Parameter: Frequency Table
** Parameter: Noise Level
** Parameter: Noise Decay Rate
** Parameter: Beats Per Minute
** Variable:  Cached/Normalized Parameters
** Variable:  Time
* LFO
** Parameter: Frequency
** Parameter: Amplitude
** Variable:  Phase
* Filter
** Parameter: Cutoff Frequency
** Parameter: Q Value
** Variable:  History Values

With this information defined, the structs for all data can be defined with
relative ease.

[source,cpp]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
include::02-basic-app.c[tag=snippet]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Now, a somewhat harsh square wave is produced with a slowly stepping sequence.
Let's add some basic librtosc handling to it.
Adding two addresses is simple enough but fairly verbose

Basic RtOsc
-----------

[source,cpp]
-------------------
if(!strcmp("/lfo/freq", msg) && !strcmp("f", rtosc_argument_string(msg)))
asdf
if(!strcmp("/lfo/amount", msg) && !strcmp("f", rtosc_argument_string(msg)))
asdf
if(!strcmp("/filter/f", msg) && !strcmp("f", rtosc_argument_string(msg)))
asdf
-------------------

The solution to this is the larger C++ API which is dedicated to making fixed
(or mostly fixed) dispatch hierarchies fairly easy to deal with, however before
moving on, I'd say it's reasonable to prove that this sort of dispatching does
indeed work.

NOTE: TODO Add Some example stuff for jack_oscsend and jack_osclfo



Ports And Hierarchies
---------------------

The RtOsc port system is a hierarchical dispatch system defined by a few key
features:

- Paths with argument specifiers and optional enumerations
- Per Port Property Maps
- Static Hierarchies
- std::function based callbacks which permit the use of lambdas

Before diving into the actual usage of the rtosc::Ports class, let's look at
what a callback should do.

A Callback is one that accepts an OSC message (no bundles here) and a reference
to an instance of rtosc::RtData.

RtData contains information about the call to the port including the current
path, the object/struct/memory to be manipulated, the port that the callback is
in, the number of matches that the osc path has made, and callbacks for
replying/broadcasting responses to the OSC message.
This class can be subclassed as needed to provide extra information.

As a first port let's add the sequencer's bpm

[source,cpp]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
include::03-basic-rtosc.cpp[tag=seq_port]
};

include::03-basic-rtosc.cpp[tag=port_base]
};
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Next update the existing rtosc code to add the dispatching:

[source,cpp]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
include::03-basic-rtosc.cpp[tag::rt_dispatch]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

For a full hierarchy it is just a matter of repeating this pattern.
This can be pretty repetitive however, so let's consider abstracting away some
of that repetition for "ports".

[source,cpp]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#define BasePort(name) {#name "/", 0, &name##_ports, [](const char *msg, \
                       rtosc::RtData &d)\
                       {while(*msg != '/') msg++; msg++; d.obj = &name; \
                       name##_ports.dispatch(msg,d);}}

rtosc::Ports ports = {
    BasePort(seq),
};
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Now adding the additional base ports is rather trivial.
This idea has been encapsulated in <rtosc/port-sugar.h> which defines a number
of similar (though somewhat more robust) macros.

Fleshing out the various port tables, we are left with:

[source,cpp]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
include::04-macro-rtosc.cpp[tab::ports]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This might seem like an effort to add too much magic in, but I'd say this sort
of definition makes for easier to read and modify code within a task which can
be very repetitive to perform.
This setup also leaves the existing structures entirely alone which permits for
very easy retrofitting of RtOsc onto existing code.


Escaping The Realtime Thread
----------------------------

As of so far everything has more or less existed on the single thread model, but
upgrading the system for use in a mutithreaded application is relatively simple.
Virtually all of the default call in RtOsc are reentrant and when possible they
tend to be pure functions.
The main bit of trickyness is moving OSC messages from the user interface to the
realtime thread.
This is accomplished with a thin wrapper around JACK's implementation of a
lock/wait free ringbuffer.
Depending on the complexity of the application it might make sense to route all
messages through some sort of middleware or it might make sense to write all
events from the user interface directly into the connecting ringbuffer.

This tutorial will consider the case of some middleware using liblo to connect
the program to some arbitrary external UI (or for the sake of avoiding any GUI
programming OSCprompt).

[source, cpp]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
include::05-middleware.cpp[]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To support this on the realtime side, a few modifications will be made.
First, an echo port will be added to help the middleware track the flow of
messages.

[source, cpp]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
include::05-lo-rtosc.cpp[tag=rtdata-impl]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Secondly, the RtData object will be subclassed to permit listening to replies.

[source, cpp]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
include::05-lo-rtosc.cpp[tag=echo-port]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Thirdly, the ringbuffer will be emptied every call to process()

[source, cpp]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
include::05-lo-rtosc.cpp[tag=buf-read]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Running the program will now result in a port getting dumped to stdout
connecting oscprompt to this will now result in getting connected to the program
from where values can be inspected and changed.
Multiple instances of oscprompt can get connected without any issue.

NOTE: TODO Add oscprompt screenshot

Documenting the API
-------------------

While moving around the program with oscprompt you may have noticed that the
right window was somewhat bare.
This is due to the fact that none of the program's ports have been documented
thus far.
The ports use doubly nulled c strings to store the parameters in a consise and
macro friendly way, however this is something that you normally don't need to
deal with due to macros like rMap(field, value) or rProp(field).
For the basic macros involved in the port definitions these properties can just
be put at the end of the macro call before the documentation string.
With this in mind, let's document things

[source, cpp]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
include::06-documented-rtosc.cpp[tag=ports]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Now the extra information will end up showing up in oscprompt, however this is
entangled with the dynamic reflection which is less than ideal.
This is where the tool oscdoc comes into play.
oscdoc is an XSLT documentation tool for OSC based APIs and rtosc supports
dumping ports to the input format.

To do so, let's modify the start of main() to

[source, cpp]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
int main(int argc, char **argv)
{
    if(argc == 3 && !strcmp(argv[1], "--dump-oscdoc")) {
        rtosc::ports_to_oscdoc(ports, argv[2]);
        return 0;
    }
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[source, shell]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
./rtosc-tutorial --dump-oscdoc oscdoc-file.xml
bla bla
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Now just open up the resulting html index to see the API documentation

User Interfaces
--------------- 

Now that all the system is setup and documented, slapping on a GUI is pretty
simple.
This portion will be in FLTK due to it's simplicity, but any toolkit should
work fine.

[source, cpp]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
include::gui.cpp[]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<1> This example will only work with one typeclass for simplicity
<2> Linear mapping between the min/max is pretty trivial to add
<3> Descriptions make reasonable basic tooltips

The end result is a pretty ugly GUI, but one that does work and it is connected
through relatively simple dispatching/reflection.

Development Grade Undo, Saving, and MIDI learning
-------------------------------------------------

Now that the UI is setup, some of the things that users might expect which can
rely heavily on the dispatch system is undo/redo, saving/loading, and
MIDI learning support.
All of these features are still under moderately heavy development, so be
prepared for some of these details to change in the future.

Right now, MIDI learning is in the roughest development stage, so that topic
will be covered last.
So, the first topic is getting a functional undo/redo system setup.

Undo/Redo
~~~~~~~~~

Now, you might think that generating an undo/redo system might be a hard task,
however it is already mostly done.
On the middleware side of things just inspect the events after changing some
parameters around

[source, cpp]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#include <rtosc/undo-history.h>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Within middleware

[source, cpp]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
UndoHistory undo_;

...

if(!strcmp("/undo_event"))
    undo_.record_event(msg);

...

void undo(void)
{
    undo_.seekHistory(-1);
}

void redo(void)
{
    undo_.seekHistory(+1);
}
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Within FLTK

[source, cpp]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
global_key_bind(CTRL_Z, undo)
global_key_bind(CTRL_Y, redo)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

And done.
All parameter types now generate the needed events to undo/redo any event sent
from a particular user interface.
Multiple user interfaces can result in getting some forms of desync, but I don't
think that an undo/redo system has any reasonable behavior in the cases when
multiple interfaces manipulate the same parameters.

Saving/Loading
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

While larger programs should try to load and save their state through more
complicated pointer swaps and pausing the world type approaches, there is more
flexibility with a smaller app.

Adding this to the port hierarchy is trivial.

[source,cpp]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#include <rtosc/subtree-serialize.h>
...
{"save:", 0, 0, [](const char *, RtData &d) {
        char buffer[2048];
        size_t res_size = subtree_serialize(buffer, 2048, NULL, &ports);
        d.reply("/save_data", "b", res_size, buffer);
    }},
{"load:b", 0, 0, [](const char *msg, RtData &) {
        rtosc_blob_t b  = rtosc_argument(msg, 0).b;
        size_t res_size = subtree_deserialize(b.data, b.len, NULL, &ports);
    }},
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Adding the support to the GUI is slightly more complicated, but still fairly
simple.


[source,cpp]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
const char *save_keys = "1234";
const char *load_keya = "!@#$";
std::queue<short> save_queue;
rtosc_blob_t saves[4];

//receive event
assert(save_queue.size() != 0);
int addr = save_queue.pop();
delete [] saves[addr].data;
saves[addr] = new char[event.len];
memcpy(save.data, event.data, event.len);
save.len = event.len;

//On load request
if(save[addr].len) {
    uToB.write("/load", "b", save[addr].len, save[addr].data);
}

//On save request
save_queue.push_back(addr);
uToB.write("/save");
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Now using 1234 and SHIFT+1234 permits loading and saving the state of the whole
program.

MIDI Learning
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Learning MIDI connections is a key feature of many applications, but this process
is not quite as trivial as the last two.

Before getting into the code, the behavior should be explained first.

1. The user interface can request to learn a midi port via a non-realtime instance
   by the OSC path
2. The non-realtime instance notifies the realtime instance of this desire to learn
   a port
3. When an unrecognized MIDI port is received by the realtime instance, then this
   port id (channel + CC) is forwarded to the non-realtime instance.
4. The non-realtime instance uses reflection on the OSC path to derive information
   on the type accepted, the scaling function, the minimum value, and the maximum
   value.
5. The non-realtime instance uses this information to generate a callback function
   instance
6. A pointer to this information is passed to the realtime instance along with the
   CC to be used
7. Future versions of the CC are passed into the callback which results in an OSC
   message which is dispatched normally

So, now that the basic flow is there, let's add in the MIDI learning support.

Middleware

[source, cpp]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#include <rtosc/miditable.h>
static rtosc::MidiMappernRT midi;

//Callbacks

void addMidiMap(const char *str);
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

RealTime

[source, cpp]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#include <rtosc/miditable.h>
static rtosc::MidiMapperRT midi;

//Callbacks
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
